Alright Satya ðŸ™‚, let's design your **3D Modeling & Project Management** application using **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles.
Iâ€™ll break it down step by step:

---

# **1. Understand Your Problem Domain**

Your app has these main capabilities:

* Users can **sign up, manage profiles, and create projects**.
* Users can **design 3D models** inside each project using **components**.
* Users have **subscription tiers** â†’ Free vs Paid.
* Users can **share projects** with other users.
* Payments & billing for **subscriptions**.
* Access control for **who can view/edit** projects.

---

# **2. Identify Subdomains**

In DDD, we split the domain into **Core**, **Supporting**, and **Generic** subdomains.

| **Subdomain**                | **Type**       | **Description**                                                                           |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project & 3D Modeling**    | **Core**       | Central part of the business â€” users create projects, add components, manage models.      |
| **Subscription & Payments**  | **Core**       | Controls which components and features are available. Includes billing and payment flows. |
| **User & Access Management** | **Supporting** | Handles sign-ups, authentication, profile, and sharing projects with others.              |
| **Component Library**        | **Supporting** | Manages catalog of 3D components available per subscription tier.                         |
| **Notifications**            | **Generic**    | Emails, alerts, and reminders (can be external service).                                  |
| **Analytics / Logging**      | **Generic**    | Tracks usage and user activity.                                                           |

# **3. Define Bounded Contexts**

Each subdomain will have one or more **bounded contexts**.
Hereâ€™s a possible breakdown:

| **Subdomain**           | **Bounded Context**           | **Responsibility**                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Project & 3D Modeling   | **Project Context**           | CRUD operations on projects, ownership, collaboration                 |
|                         | **Modeling Context**          | Stores & manages 3D models, handles transformations, object hierarchy |
| Subscription & Payments | **Subscription Context**      | Defines plans, user entitlements, and upgrade/downgrade rules         |
|                         | **Billing Context**           | Integrates with Stripe/Razorpay for payments, invoices                |
| User & Access           | **User Context**              | Manages user profile, authentication                                  |
|                         | **Sharing Context**           | Handles sharing projects with other users, permissions                |
| Component Library       | **Component Catalog Context** | Stores components, filters them based on subscription tier            |
| Notifications           | **Notification Context**      | Sends emails, reminders, payment alerts                               |

# **5. Suggested Initial Microservices**

We donâ€™t want too many microservices upfront, so we start with the **core** ones first. Later, we can split further as the app grows.

| **Microservice**                            | **Bounded Contexts Covered**  | **Responsibility**                                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **User Service**                            | User Context, Sharing Context | Handles authentication, profile, and project sharing |
| **Project Service**                         | Project Context               | Manages projects, collaborators                      |
| **Modeling Service**                        | Modeling Context              | Handles 3D models, placements, rendering data        |
| **Subscription Service**                    | Subscription Context          | Manages plans, entitlements, and upgrades            |
| **Billing Service**                         | Billing Context               | Handles payment gateways, invoices, receipts         |
| **Component Service**                       | Component Catalog Context     | Stores components and filters based on tier          |
| **Notification Service** *(optional later)* | Notification Context          | Emails, payment reminders                            |

# **7. Recommended Initial Steps**

1. Start with a **monolith** structured around **bounded contexts** â†’ separate folders/modules per context.
2. Implement **User Service**, **Project Service**, and **Component Service** first.
3. Add **Subscription Service** + **Billing Service** next.
4. Once stable, evolve into **microservices**.

---

# **8. Key Takeaways**

* **Core Subdomains**: Project & 3D Modeling, Subscription & Payments.
* **Supporting Subdomains**: Component Catalog, User Sharing.
* **Generic Subdomains**: Notifications, Analytics.
* **Start with 5â€“6 microservices** max â†’ avoid over-engineering.
* **Keep value objects immutable** â†’ positions, dimensions, billing cycles, etc.
* Use **events** between contexts, e.g.:

  * `SubscriptionUpgraded` â†’ unlocks premium components.
  * `ProjectShared` â†’ triggers email notification.

---

If you want, I can **draw a proper DDD domain diagram** for your application showing:

* Subdomains
* Bounded contexts
* Aggregates
* Entities & Value Objects
* Microservice boundaries

Itâ€™ll be easier to visualize than just tables and text.

Should I prepare that **visual architecture diagram** for you? Itâ€™ll make the DDD structure much clearer.
